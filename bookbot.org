** Snippets & Explanations
*** Read Files
- with block can be used to open file:
- We assign variable to the text we obtain by reading the file .read()
- with block will auto-close the file when done reading it, to
   preserve resources
  
#+BEGIN_SRC python
with open("") as f:
    book_content = f.read()
#+END_SRC
*** Refactoring
- Refactoring is a fancy word for "rewriting your god-awful code so it's not so terrible." Refactoring doesn't change the behavior of your code, just the way it's written.
- How to refactor:
  1) Move function to another file
  2) Import file / function that you moved it out of.

     Syntax: 
     from stats import get_book_words

**** main.py
- Main point of entry for the program & every component that doesn't
   fit elsewhere.

**** stats.py
- Contains functions to analyze the text.
